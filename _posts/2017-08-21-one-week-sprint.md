title: One Week Sprint

Working on a project from start to end has always been a big problem for me. I'd start one, get halfway through and simply abandon it. To try and break out of this mindset I'm trying a one week sprint methodology. Each week (Sunday-Friday) I will build a prototype of an idea that i have for an app/website/system and release it online. This way I can level up my skills, get a sense of accomplishment and try many different ideas to see which ones stick.

## Week 1: The Error Journal
For my first week I decided to build a simple web app to store my code errors and solutions using Django and bootstrap for the site. The site should perform the following by the end of the week:
+ I should be able to save a code snippet and a description of the error it's fixing.
+ I should be able to view and edit all my code snippets.
+ I should be able to search through the snippets by title or description of the error or tag.

Additional functionalities, if I have time, are:
+ A sign up/login feature for different users
+ Better styling, bells and whistles
+ A sharing feature

After 2 days of floundering looking for a good free django host for the site I finally settled on alwaysdata. The prototype's link is here [ErrorJournal](kmapps.alwaysdata.net/home). I will probably be moving to a different host soon though.
