I have decided to take the 100 days of code challenge and I am going to document it here in my blog and on my twitter to keep myself motivated.
My twitter will have a day to do update of my progress whilst this blog will be updated twice a week and will have more in depth details on what i have been working on.

### Day 1:

Currently learning about processing and decided to code up a Lorenz attractor based on a tutorial on the coding train by Dan Shiffman.
I modified my lorenz attractor though, using the sound library i have coded it to only move when the inout sound is of a certain amplitutde. And a randomness is also added to the shape based on amplitude of the input sound.

The gif below doesn't have any sound but that's how my lorenz attractor works, looking forward to making more interesting stuff in processing over the next 99 days!
