It's been said you need to spend 10000 hours on something to master it. I decided for a coding challenge to create an android app in processing to log progress to that 10'000 hour goal.
This app required 2 basic things, a stopwatch and way to save your progress.

### The Stopwatch

I accomplished this with a little help with some tutorials online. The following code was used to create the stopwatch functionality.
``` java
void updateTime() {
  if (start) {
    if (int(millis()/100) % 10 != millisecs) {
      millisecs++;
    }
    if (millisecs >= 10) {
      millisecs %= 10;
      sec++;
    }
    if (sec >= 60) {
      sec %= 60;
      min++;
    }
    if (min >= 60) {
      min %= 60;
      hour++;
    }
  }
}
```

I was initially using processing second() function to try to update the clock, but i was having a weird bug where after a number of seconds it stops increasing normally.
After a search online I found that using the millis() function works well and has no bugs.

### Saving to JSON

I decided to use JSON to save the time logged on the app. I created a JSON array storing a JSON objects.
The JSONObjects store the seconds, minutes, hours and the date that it was saved on.

``` java
void recordTime() {
  JSONArray values = json.getJSONArray("timeValues");
  JSONObject currentTime = new JSONObject();
  String date = String.valueOf(day()) + String.valueOf(month()) + String.valueOf(year());
  currentTime.setInt("seconds", sec);
  currentTime.setInt("minutes", min);
  currentTime.setInt("hours", hour);
  currentTime.setString("date", date);
  values.append(currentTime);
  saveJSONObject(json, "data.json");
}
```

### Final Touches

The app need's a few more flourishes before I publish it to the playstore. Some animations, a background or some kind of generative background and possibly a sign in system to allow saving times to the cloud.
